        schema1:description "American author, journalist, publisher, and collector Robert Carlton Brown (1886-1959) was born in Chicago. Brown wrote pulp fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, avant-garde publications, and experimented with a book of visual poetry; he also contributed pieces to various magazines and newspapers in New York City and established journals in Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, and London. Popular works of Brown's include the novel What Happened to Mary? (1913), an adaptation of which became one of the first successful motion pictures. He was involved with an informal poetry group with avant-garde and modernist writers and artists like William Carlos Williams, Alfred Kreymbourg, and Man Ray in 1913 and 1914. The group put forth a publication entitled Glebe in 1913 and later the influential poetry journal Others. In 1929, he and his wife temporarily settled in France where they became involved in the expatriate literary community in Paris. While there, he also established Roving Eye Press to promote a reading machine that he invented. Brown published a book of verse to be used with the machine, Readies for Bob Brown's Machine (1931), which included contributions from Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, James T. Farrell, Kay Boyle, Paul Bowles, Kreymborg, Eugene Jolas, and Robert McAlmon. This collection includes correspondence, clippings, visual poetry, photographs, and ephemera.

He served variously as president of the Baltimore Trust Company, director of American Airlines, and vice president of the National Dairy Products Corporation. He and his family also had ties to diplomacy and early in his life, just prior to enlistment for World War I, Bruce served as private secretary to his uncle, Thomas Nelson Page, U. S. Ambassador to Italy. Several years later, from 1947 to 1949, Bruce himself served as U. S. Ambassador to Argentina. He subsequently served as the director of the Foreign Military Assistance Program, forerunner of NATO, before returning to his career in business in 1950. The materials in this collection focus on the years 1910 to 1960 and treat a variety of subjects such as Bruce's years at Princeton; his military and diplomatic service; and a 1958 campaign for a U. S. Senate seat. News clippings, publications, by Bruce and others, audio-visual materials, and correspondence are included. Letters from numerous prominent individuals, including Juan and Eva Peron, John F. Kennedy, Harry S. Truman, and Dean Acheson, form a significant portion of the collection.

After graduating from the U.S. Military Academy in 1831, Emory devoted most of his life to the U.S. Army. Upon retirement in 1876 he had attained the rank of brigadier general and had served in the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, and on what is historically known as the \"Indian Frontier,\" land in south-central United States that the US government established after forcibly removing Indigenous people in the east from their land. The documents in the collection consist of a letterbook, a biography drawn up shortly before retirement, and some loose correspondence with his wife, Matilda Wilkins Bache Emory. Several of his letters center around a period of transition in the early 1860s when Emory was serving in Indian Territory but preparing for removal to the East for service with the Union forces against the Confederacy." ;

        schema1:description """Catherine "Cassie" Mackin (1939-1982) was a television network correspondent noted for her national politics and government knowledge. After graduating from the University of Maryland, she worked for the Baltimore Sun from 1960-1963 and the Hearst newspapers' Washington bureau from 1963-1969. She began her television career at WRC-TV in Washington, where she worked from 1969 to 1971. She was then hired by NBC News and was the network's first female correspondent to serve as a floor reporter at the Democratic and National Conventions in 1972. In 1976, she became the first woman to anchor an evening network newscast regularly. Switching to ABC in 1977, Mackin served as Senate correspondent and covered the 1980 Democratic primary campaign of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.

Her papers reflect her work as a political correspondent and reporter for the Hearst News Bureau and two television news networks. The collection includes notes and articles on significant political figures and events and an extensive file of articles by Mackin and audiotapes of speeches and interviews and videotapes of her broadcasts. The majority of the later dated materials document the 1972 presidential race and Senator Edward M. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1980.

Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and Sherwood Anderson. After graduating from Harvard University in 1916, he volunteered to be an ambulance driver in World War I. His experiences there led to the bitter antiwar novel Three Soldiers (1921). In the postwar years he also produced his trilogy U. S. A., which consists of The 42nd Parallel (1930); 1919 (1932); and The Big Money (1936). Dos Passos worked as a newspaper correspondent during World War II and continued to write novels after the war. He published forty-two novels, as well as poems, essays, and plays. He was also a student of art and created and exhibited more than 400 pieces of art. The Dos Passos papers include manuscripts and notes relating to his translation of Panama; or, The Adventures of My Seven Uncles (1931), his play Fortune Heights (1934), and his novel Manhattan Transfer (1925), as well as correspondence and manuscripts related to his work in the theater." ;

        schema1:description "American poet Robert Frost (1874-1963) was born in San Francisco, California. After the death of his father, the family moved to New England, which provided the backdrop for Frost's trademark regional poetry. Frost briefly attended both Dartmouth College and Harvard University but did not earn a degree. Frost initially encountered difficulties in establishing himself as a published poet in American newspapers and literary journals. After little success in America, Frost and his family moved to England for three years, which proved to be more fertile publishing ground. By the time he returned to the United States in 1915, Frost had published two well-received full-length collections, A Boy's Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), which solidified his reputation on both continents. By the 1920s, he was the most celebrated poet in America. Frost was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature four times: for New Hampshire (1923), Collected Poems (1930), A Further Range (1936), and A Witness Tree (1942). Frost received more than forty honorary degrees from colleges and universities, including Oxford and Cambridge Universities, Amherst College, and the University of Michigan. He also had the honor of participating in President John F. Kennedy's inauguration ceremonies, 1961, by reading his poems \"Dedication\" and \"The Gift Outright.\" This collection includes manuscripts of \"Closed for Good\" and \"The Middleness of the Road\"; page proofs of the verse drama A Masque of Reason (1942) and galley proofs of Steeple Bush (1947); art work, photographs, correspondence, work papers, an award, sheet music, serials, and audio recordings of Frost. The collection is unprocessed, but a preliminary inventory is available." ;

        schema1:description "Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin was born in south Baltimore in 1900 and graduated from the University of Maryland Law School with a bachelor's degree in law in 1925. McKeldin's political career in Maryland spans five decades, beginning with his political appointment as executive secretary to Mayor William F. Broening of Baltimore in 1927. McKeldin was mayor of Baltimore himself from 1943 to 1947. As governor of Maryland from 195l to 1959, McKeldin launched a vigorous program of reform and reconstruction, which included the Sobeloff Commission on State Government and Bureaucratic Administration and a twelve year plan for state highway construction. He achieved nationwide prominence at the 1952 Republican Convention when he was selected to nominate Dwight D. Eisenhower for the presidency. During McKeldin's second term as mayor, which lasted from 1963 to 1967, he embarked upon a wide ranging program of urban renewal, which included the beginnings of the redevelopment of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, construction of a new municipal building, and the planned elimination of the city's slums. However, this urban renewal program ultimately displaced over 800 households and around 3,000 residents of predominantly Black neighborhoods due to the destruction of hundreds of homes. Businesses were also displaced resulting in the loss of over 500 jobs in the community and causing barriers to daily life for residents without cars due to this urban renewal program headed by McKeldin. McKeldin also continued to support the civil rights movement by hosting a meeting of the Congress of Racial Equality in July 1966. After his retirement from the Baltimore political scene, McKeldin's interests and activities remained varied. In 1967, President Johnson appointed him to a panel of American observers chosen to supervise the September elections in South Vietnam. In 1968, McKeldin testified in opposition to capital punishment before the United States Congress. He was a vocal supporter of the state of Israel, founder and president of the America-Israel Society, and he assisted with the sale of Israeli war bonds throughout the 1960s. McKeldin retired in 1968 and died on August 10, 1974, at the age of seventy-three. The Papers of Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin include speeches (largely delivered during his gubernatorial years); appointment books; office files (mostly gubernatorial); papers from national conferences which he attended; books, programs, pamphlets, brochures; and other miscellaneous materials. There are also scrapbooks of newspaper articles pertaining to his career, audiotapes of various speeches, photographs, and memorabilia." ;

        schema1:description "Harry J. Patterson was associated with the University of Maryland for fifty years, from 1888 to 1937. He arrived as part of the staff of the Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station and made significant contributions to agriculture in the state of Maryland. Patterson was instrumental in raising awareness throughout the state of the value of research in agriculture for the improvement of the state's economy and tax base. And, through his work on the applications of chemistry to farming, new varieties of tobacco and strawberries were developed. Patterson's most enduring contributions to the state, however, were made between 1913 and 1917 when he served as president of the University of Maryland. In those four years Patterson undertook the rebuilding of the campus after a fire in 1912 and launched the University on a course of expansion, preparing the campus for a shift in status from a small college to a large, public, and modern university. Patterson's papers consist of correspondence; speeches; rosters; and lecture, experiment, and chemical notes." ;

A. in 1910 from Harvard, where he also pursued a doctoral degree in philosophy. In 1915, he married Vivienne (Vivien) Haigh-Wood. He was literary editor of the avant-garde magazine The Egoist. In the Spring 1917, he published his first book of poetry, Prufrock and Other Observations. In 1922, Eliot published \"The Waste Land\" and became editor of The Criterion. 1927 was a momentous year for Eliot. In June, he was baptized into the Church of England, and, in November, became a British citizen. His religion then became a central component of his life and his poetry reflected this religious conversion. In 1948, Eliot received both the Order of Merit and the Nobel Prize for Literature. The collection includes correspondence; manuscripts and proofs of published Eliot literary works such as \"Lines to a Persian Cat,\" \"In silent corridors of death,\" and \"The Love-Song of J. Arthur Prufrock;\" galley proofs for plays and collections of poetry; manuscripts of Vivienne (Haigh-Wood) Eliot; serial publications with contributions by Eliot; newspaper clippings; a proof of a literary review of Eliot; manuscripts written by other individuals; programs and playbills." ;

Flint learned about hardship at an early age when his family lost its farm during the Great Depression. After a failed first attempt at college, Flint enrolled in the Marines and served in post-war Korea. It was during his military service that he decided to give college a second chance, and, when he returned to the United States, he enrolled at the University of North Dakota where he received a B.A. in 1958. Flint continued his education at Marquette University, where he completed a master's degree (1960), and the University of Minnesota--the topic of his 1968 doctoral dissertation was Theodore Roethke. In 1968, Flint joined the Georgetown University (Washington, DC) faculty where he taught English literature and creative writing until his retirement in 1997. During his career, Flint authored six collections of poetry, contributed poems to numerous national periodicals including the Atlantic Monthly and served as poet laureate of Maryland from 1995 until 2000. The collection includes letters, serials, speeches, monographs, notes for courses, notes for readings, photographs, newspaper clippings, drafts of poems, poetry readings on audio and video tape, and unpublished works.

There is also correspondence between Zug and his friends and associates in the temperance movement. After John Zug's death and Margaret Zug's remarriage sometime before 1846, there was extensive communication between Margaret and a cousin who moved from Pennsylvania to Richmond, Virginia, and reported her impressions of her new home and society." ;

The bulk of the Chesley Collection concerns research conducted for the National List of Historic Theatre Buildings, as well as Chesley's involvement in restoration projects undertaken during the 1970s. The depth of information concerning individual theatres varies considerably, depending on the thoroughness of the person(s) who responded to Chesley's letter of inquiry.

The papers consist primarily of correspondence relating to day-to-day business and family subjects, including Hubert Kelly Waldron's murder in 1848. But the family also witnessed some of the most turbulent times in Ireland's history, including the potato blight and subsequent famines, mass emigration, and the Fenian uprisings." ;

        schema1:description "Robert Fergusson and Alexander Hamilton were buying agents for Scottish trading firms during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Both Fergusson and Hamilton were born in Scotland, but came to Maryland as young men and established themselves both as agents and as men of property. Fergusson owned Nanjemoy, an estate in Charles County, though he lived in Georgetown and later at \"Mulberry Grove,\" also in Charles County, near Port Tobacco. Hamilton maintained a sizeable estate in Prince George's County and enslaved more than ten people at the time of his death in 1799. The papers date from 1761 to 1827, with the majority of documents dating from the 1780s and 1790s. The bulk of the papers consist of correspondence between Scottish firms such as Glassford &amp; Company and their Maryland representatives Fergusson and Hamilton. Other documents include statements of debts incurred by planters and storekeepers with whom the agents dealt, records of the disposition of estates, and some agreements about the running of Fergusson's own estate. The collection also includes a number of legal writs from Worcestershire, England, and several drafted commentaries on a 1786 debate in the Maryland legislature on how to ease the post-Revolutionary War economic depression. The authorship and precise date of the political commentaries are unclear." ;

        schema1:description "Little is known concerning the details of the life of Reuben Gilder, other than various accounts of his military service during the War of 1812 in the Fort Niagara, Canada, theater of war, along with selected subsequent experiences in the capacity of a retired military man and unsuccessful merchant in Baltimore during the 1810s and 1820s. Reuben Gilder married an Eliza Mary Hughes in Baltimore on February 17, 1819. According to Gilder's own accounts, he and his wife had at least one son, possibly named Columbus Franklin Gilder. Court records show that Reuben Gilder and his wife were granted a divorce on February 12, 1836. Gilder attempted a life in national politics, as evident from his application for the position of Doorkeeper (today Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper) of the U. S. Senate, which he failed to obtain. Gilder also suffered from various post-war ailments and health problems. The papers of Reuben Gilder consist of twenty-six letters written by Gilder to his former military comrade, Isaac Dutton Barnard, between 1815 and 1822. Subjects covered in the correspondence include: former military comrades, acquaintances, and experiences related to the War of 1812 in Canadian territory; military conflict with the Creek tribes of Native Americans; a variety of contemporaneous political matters and figures, including those in the local, national, and international arenas; and family, business, and health matters. Another, separate letter included in the papers was written by Reuben Gilder's wife, Eliza M. Gilder, in 1823. This letter is an urgent appeal to Isaac D. Barnard for his written recommendation for a military disability pension on behalf of her husband, Reuben Gilder. In a final, type-faced document of 1828, Reuben Gilder himself, Isaac D. Barnard, and the unknown individuals N. Towson and George Gibson all write on behalf of Reuben Gilder's ultimately unsuccessful quest to become Doorkeeper of the U. S. Senate." ;

The Bureau of Business Practice records consists of publications dating from the years when the BBP was known as the National Foreman's Institute to just prior to the closing of the BBP Branch of Aspen Publishers. Publications such as the \"Better Secretaries Series\" from the early 1960s focus on training for office employees through instruction in secretarial principles, such as accounting or letter writing.

A long-time resident of Kansas City, Dillon began her involvement with historic theaters in 1974, when she purchased the Folly Theater in the city center. Over the next thirteen years she raised more than $5 million to renovate the former burlesque hall. Her activities with the Folly Theater led to her involvement with the League of Historic American Theaters (LHAT), on whose Board of Directors she served after 1978. Through her growing involvement with theaters, she met David Naylor, a photographer and author of two books on American movie theaters. Together they decided to pursue Dillon's longstanding idea of a book on nineteenth-century American theaters. In the period between 1994 and 1996, they traveled extensively, viewing, evaluating, and photographing theaters throughout the United States. The resulting book, American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century, appeared in 1997. The papers focus exclusively on the research, preparation and publication of American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century. The collection documents theaters included in the book, as well as theaters that were considered for inclusion but rejected.

Prange conducted interviews and collected accounts from diaries, articles, and correspondence with many of the key participants in the battle, both Japanese and American, as well as completed extensive research on the causes, planning, build-up to, and execution and consequences of the attack. Prange's Pearl Harbor research was published posthumously in three volumes: At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor (1981), Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History (1986), and December 7, 1941: The Day the Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor (1988). The Gordon W. Prange Papers cover the period from 1866 to 2002, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1936 to 1980. The collection consists of both personal and professional papers and includes unpublished manuscripts, correspondence, interview notes and transcripts, research notes, articles, maps, and photographs related to Prange’s research on the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway, the Russian spy Richard Sorge, and the speeches of Adolf Hitler.

        schema1:description "The Japan-America Student Conference (JASC) is a non-profit educational and cultural exchange program for university students from the United States and Japan. The first Conference was held in 1934 in Tokyo and was initiated by a small group of Japanese university students concerned about the deterioration of relations between the United States and Japan. The Conference was held each year until the Second World War forced a postponement; it was revived in 1947 by American and Japanese students then living in Japan. After a second interruption beginning in the mid 1950s, the 16th JASC was held in 1964 in the United States and has alternated betweeen the U. S. and Japan every year since. The collection consists of publications, conference materials, brochures, posters, planning documents, and administrative files. Also included are photographs and scrapbooks collected by JASC members and alumni. Notable JASC alumni include Kiichi Miyazawa, the former Prime Minister of Japan (JASC 1939 and 1940) and Henry Kissinger, the former U. S. Secretary of State (JASC 1951)." ;

In 1987, Maryland's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) purchased the land that comprises North Point State Park from Bethlehem Steel and began to develop plans for the park, including such facilities as a refurbished trolley station, parking lot, visitors' center, and boat slip. The Coalition strongly objected to the DNR's plans and spearheaded a number of non-litigious activities to raise awareness about Black Marsh and to voice concern about the DNR's proposal. In addition, the group unsuccessfully pursued several legal actions hoping to change the DNR's plans for the park. In Summer 1996, the Coalition became the Friends of North Point State Park and appears to have disbanded officially in Summer 1997. The collection contains minutes and correspondence of the Coalition; records of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' activities relating to the development of North Point State Park; copies of publicity campaigns, including relevant articles; maps and photographs of the state park; a video of a panel hearing in 1991; and official and unofficial documentation of the Coalition's legal activity, including files kept by its attorneys.

He received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Williams College in 1959 and a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1966. He began a career in politics as an administrative assistant to Minneapolis Mayor Arthur Naftalin (1961-1962) and then served as administrative assistant to Minnesota Lieutenant Governor A.M. Keith (1963-1967). In 1967, Moe became the finance director for the Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party and, in 1969, became the second youngest chairman of the party, a post he held until 1972 when he joined the staff of Senator Walter F. Mondale as an administrative assistant. In 1977, Moe became the chief of staff for Vice President Mondale during the Carter administration. In 1981, Moe joined the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell, where he became a partner in 1986. During his time at the law firm, he took time off to participate in Walter Mondale's run for president in 1984 as well as serving in advisory roles during the 1988 and 1992 presidential campaigns. In 1993, Moe became the seventh president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a position he held until 2010. Moe's first book, The Last Full Measure: the Life and Death of the Minnesota Volunteers, was published in 1993 as well. The Moe papers include documents related to Moe's political and legal career and consist primarily of correspondence, memos, campaign files, clippings, oral histories, and photographs." ;

        schema1:description """William Morris (1834-1896) was an English artist, author, social activist, teacher, designer, craftsman, printer, bibliophile, preservationist, translator, and literary scholar. He is best known for his association with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, as a central figure of the English Arts and Crafts Movement, and as the founder of the Kelmscott Press.

Morris rose to popularity as the author of the epic poem The Earthly Paradise (1868-1870). Morris's other well known works encompassed several genres and styles, including narrative poetry, fantasy and utopian novels, translations of Icelandic and other early works, essays, and short stories. Some of his notable works include The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems (1858), A Dream of John Ball (1888), News from Nowhere (1890), and The Wood Beyond the World (1894).

Morris founded the popular design firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner, & Co. in 1861, which was restructured as Morris & Company in 1875. Morris was also influential in the emergence of socialism in England in the nineteenth century, having founded the Socialist League in 1884. In 1891, Morris founded the Kelmscott Press, with the goal of producing beautiful books that imitated the craftsmanship of the Medieval era. The press produced 53 titles during its 7-years in operation. His 1896 edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, referred to as the Kelmscott Chaucer, is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful printed books in existence.

The collection includes correspondence from Sydney Cockerell, Jane Morris, and William Morris, a manuscript by Stopford Augustus Brooke, as well as books printed at the Kelmscott press, books from Morris' personal library, and ephemera.

        schema1:description "American author John Steinbeck (1902-1968) was born in Salinas, California. His upbringing in a rural town and summers spent working alongside migrant workers at neighboring ranches would provided themes and settings for his characteristically regional style. In 1919, Steinbeck graduated from Salinas High School and attended Stanford University intermittently until 1925, eventually leaving without a degree. Steinbeck moved to New York City, attempting to live a writer's life, but failing to publish, he returned to California. He spent most of the years of the Great Depression in the Monterey Peninsula in California, his literary activities supported by his father. Steinbeck's first successful novel Tortilla Flat was published in 1935, for which he received the California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. The next four years brought what has become known as his \"Dust Bowl\" fiction: Of Mice and Men (1937) and the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939). Steinbeck's most well known works of fiction include: Cannery Row (1945), The Pearl (1947), East of Eden (1952), and The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), his final novel. Steinbeck's oeuvre also includes six non-fiction works and five collections of short stories, as well as numerous journalistic pieces from his time as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune during World War II. Many of his novels were successfully adapted for the screen. In 1962, Steinbeck was honored with the Nobel Prize for Literature. The collection consists of manuscripts of galley and page proofs for The Winter of Our Discontent, as well as a metal die used for imprinting the volume's spine title." ;

The consolidation of four local unions located in Washington, D.C.,--884, 190, 1651, and 1103--formed Local 132. The new union received its charter on October 25, 1905. Originally, Local 132 had its headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., and met every Friday at the Typographical Temple. Members of Local 132 broke ground on a Carpenter's Hall in 1926. This building served as a home for the local union until 1981, when Local 132 moved its headquarters from downtown Washington, D.C., to Suitland, Maryland. Shortly thereafter, Local 132 moved to Forestville, Maryland. In 2008, the union again moved its offices to its present location in Upper Marlboro where it shares the building with the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council of Carpenters (MARCC), the regional council associated with the UBCJA. Local 132 is one of 27 local unions affiliated with MARCC. The archives of Local 132 primarily consist of general administrative files, including meeting minutes and correspondence, as well as membership files that mainly consist of applications. Other items in the collection include financial records, publications, contractor files, memorabilia, and photographs. Among the topics addressed are building projects, equality for all unionized workers, and the national union." ;

His family moved to northern California during Wilkins's childhood, and Wilkins later attended Humboldt State College, graduating in 1951. Wilkins and his college sweetheart, Fern Stahl (born 1927), married in 1952. After graduation, Wilkins joined the Navy, for which he served until his retirement in 1974 at the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Wilkins's military career resulted in many moves for him, Fern, and their two children, bringing the family to Maryland for Wilkins's positions at National Security Agency Headquarters and a communication station in Cheltenham, Maryland. While Bill Wilkins was stationed in Maryland, Fern Wilkins began her own career as a Montessori teacher. Fern Wilkins died on April 20, 2008, in Columbia, Maryland. The Wilkins family met Katherine Anne Porter in November 1968 after the funeral of their son David. Fern Wilkins's cousin, Robert Beach, a member of the University of Maryland's University Relations staff, had driven the family to the funeral at Arlington Cemetery, and decided to stopped at Porter's Washington, D.C., residence after the service. Porter invited the Wilkinses into her home for lunch. From this kind gesture, a warm friendship developed. Bill Wilkins joined Porter as her assistant from April 1976 until June 1977; during this time, Porter and Wilkins worked on The Never-Ending Wrong (1977) and her never-published biography of Cotton Mather. Wilkins later worked for the Assistant Superintendent of the Maryland School for the Blind in Baltimore, Maryland, until his retirement in June 1995. From 1996 until 2003, he volunteered in support of the University of Maryland Libraries' Porter holdings and other literary manuscript collections.

Designed by Howard Sill, a well-known Baltimore architect, the estate was built for the wealthy Gilpin family of Baltimore.

Through the years, MAC evolved into a more public institution that specilized in agriculture and engineering. Noted early alumni include Harry Clifton Byrd (class of 1908) who later became president of the College, Hershel Allen (1910) who build bridges over the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware River, William Cole (1910), US Congressman and judge, and Millard Tydings (1910), MD Senator.

This collection mostly consists of photographs documenting life for early MAC students between the 1880s and 1916. The images cover a broad range of topics, including students and faculty life and studies; buildings and farming on campus, classrooms and laboratories; the campus farm and greenhouses; athletic events -- specifically football, lacrosse, baseball, and track; and the Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station. Photographs of particular interest are those capturing the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1912, dormitory life in Calvert Hall, and many of the college's first athletic teams. Also included in this collection are several MAC pennants belonging to Urah Long, Class of 1907; Principles of Soils Management, a textbook used for a soils short course in 1914; the 1892 diploma of Pyon Su, the first Korean college graduate in the United States, and a MAC cadet student uniform worn by John Philip Hanson Mason, class of 1913.

        schema1:description "John Pauker (1920-1991) was born in Budapest, Hungary, and raised in New York City. He attended Yale University where he edited the freshman magazine '42 and the literary magazine Furioso. Much of his career was spent with the United States Information Agency for which he served as policy officer, editor, and political commentator between 1953 and 1970, then later became Deputy Chief National Security Adviser for the Office of Plans. Pauker, who spoke seven languages, also worked as propaganda analyst at the Office of War Information and as a White House speech writer. In addition to his government duties, Pauker maintained an active interest in the arts. He was an art aficionado, author, critic, editor, and translator. Pauker's poems and short stories, which have appeared in numerous periodicals and under various pen names, have also been anthologized. His English translation of Lajos Zilahy's The Dukays was a bestseller in 1949, and his adaptation of Marcel Ayme's Les Oiseaux de Lune was produced on Broadway as Moonbirds (1956). Pauker's other major publications include two volumes of poetry: Yoked By Violence (1949) and Excellency (1968). In addition to his own creative and critical pursuits, Pauker and his first wife Virginia shared an art dealership. This collection includes correspondence, clippings, notes and drafts of his works, some work-related material, copies of Furioso, serials, and audio and video tapes of interviews, readings, and music. The collection is unprocessed, but a preliminary inventory is available." ;

        schema1:description "The literary movement German Expressionism generally dates from around 1905 to 1945. It arose as a reaction against materialism, complacent bourgeois prosperity, rapid mechanization and urbanization, and the domination of the family within pre-World War I European society. It was the dominant literary movement in Germany during and immediately after World War I. The authors explored in their works the predicaments of representative symbolic types rather than of fully developed individualized characters. Expressionist poetry was similarly nonreferential and sought an ecstatic, hymn like lyricism that would have considerable associative power. This condensed, stripped-down poetry, utilizing strings of nouns and a few adjectives and infinitive verbs, eliminated narrative and description to capture the essence of feeling. The dominant themes of Expressionist verse were horror at urban life and apocalyptic visions of the collapse of civilization. This collection of approximately sixty individual items includes correspondence and manuscripts, of both prose and poetry, by forty individuals including Leonhard Frank, George Groz, Oskar Kokoscha, Else Lasker-Schuler, Ernst Toller, and Franz Werfel." ;

Most of the items relate to the 1941-1948 time period. Similar material in the Shishkin papers at the University of Maryland is most complete for the early 1930s and the 1950s and beyond.

In addition, there is a significant amount of correspondence from publishers, faculty, and other Roman scholars, as well as personal correspondence from family members and friends. Highlights in the collection consist mainly of drafts, notes, and correspondence related to two of her notable publications The Gardens of Pompeii and A Pompeian Herbal. An entire box is devoted to essays, maps, and correspondence from Gardens of the Roman Empire, a scholarly compilation edited by Jashemski and published after her death.

Originally, the program was broadcast nationwide for 40 hours from 8 am Saturday to midnight on Sunday. Monitor was soon shortened to 32 hours every weekend (excluding overnight programming) and remained at that length through 1961. The program's marathon-length was a sharp departure from the usual 15- and 30-minute network radio programming. With a "magazine-of-the-air" format, Monitor offered various short segments, including news, sports, interviews, and music. Comedy segments incorporated what remained of NBC's long-running programs (such as Fibber McGee and Molly) and newer comedians (such as Mike Nichols and Elaine May). 

This collection consists of copies of newspaper clippings, correspondence, memoranda, publicity announcements, transcripts, and photographs collected by broadcast journalism scholar Dennis Hart between 1955 and 1975. The collection also includes vinyl records and VHS tapes produced by Monitor as well as compilation CDs created by Dennis Hart.

(BMI) is primarily a performing rights management organization, collecting license fees for recorded music and distributing royalty payments to the artists. It was founded in 1939 by the National Association of Broadcasters and, for many years, provided additional customer services such as market research, promotional ideas, script services, orchestrations, and complete programs.

During the 1950s, BMI organized clinics at multiple locations throughout the United States and Canada that provided opportunities for radio personnel to exchange new ideas on local programming. These clinics addressed a wide range of issues, including programming strategy, advertising sales, station promotion, public service, news, and specialized audience programs. Eventually, television program managers were also attending clinics to share their successes and failures. During the peak year in 1956, there were 42 BMI program clinics held across the country. The clinics were suspended in 1958. 

The collection consists of 536 audio tapes, two scrapbooks, and three boxes of photographs from the annual BMI banquet. The recordings date from 1951-1957 and were created at clinics held across the country.

"Series books" are books that consistently feature the same protagonist.  However unlike "books in a series", the characters in "series books" seldom mature, age, or change.  The protagonist in a "girls' series" book is usually a girl in her late teens or early twenties who goes on adventures on her own or with a small group of friends' around her age.  The heroines of girls' series usually had an interesting career such as an amateur sleuth, a nurse, or a stewardess.  Girls' series books were often disparaged for their formulaic plots and the cheap manufacture of the books themselves.

The majority of books in this collection were donated by Elissa Pangani in honor of her parents Rose and Joseph Pangani.  The collection includes series such as the Nancy Drew Mystery Series, the Cherry Ames Nurse Stories, the Dana Girls Mystery Stories, and the Vicki Barr Flight Stewardess Series.

Pulp magazines were inexpensive popular fiction works published from the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, characteristically printed on cheap wood pulp paper. Pulp magazines initially contained a variety of different genres of fiction, including mystery and adventure genres, but in the 1920s magazines devoted to science fiction began to appear more frequently. Science fiction pulp magazines typically featured colorful cover art, along with short stories that embraced futuristic and fantasy themes, highlighting technology, space travel, otherworldly  creatures, scientific innovation, and unexplored environments.  Some of the pulps such as Air Wonder Stories attempted to provide educational value to their stories by basing them on accurate scientific principles. Other titles, such as Astounding Stories of Super-Science, focused on providing the best price value with high page counts and low prices. The addition of letter columns in pulp magazines helped the fandom surrounding the genre grow as fans began to reach out to the addresses published alongside the letters. As science fiction progressed into the 1930s and 1940s, stories began to place a greater emphasis on plot and characterization. This collection’s titles include multi-genre pulps like The Strand and pulps devoted solely to science fiction such as Stirring Science Stories. Early titles featured stories written by H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Alexander Pushkin, and Jules Verne. 

The collection contains 365 volumes of Sci-Fi pulps from 12 different title families. The pulps were published between 1891 and 1990, with the majority published between 1930 and 1961.

        schema1:description """Lt. Colonel Victor E. Delnore commanded the Allied Occupation Forces in Nagasaki Prefecture from 1946 to 1949.  As head of the Nagasaki Military Government Team, Delnore supervised early efforts to rebuild the atomic bomb-ravaged city of Nagasaki and to restore peace and stability throughout the prefecture. The Victor E. Delnore Papers include policy statements, directives, speeches (most notably his 1948 address at the historic first Nagasaki ceremony commemorating victims of the atomic bombing), personal albums, photographs, letters, newspaper articles, and documentary films. The albums and several of the other items were farewell gifts to Delnore upon his departure from Nagasaki. 

While complying with orders from the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), at the same time Delnore championed the rights of the Nagasaki citizenry. One of his primary goals was to foster mutually respectful relations between the Americans and the Japanese. His efforts earned him the admiration of his soldiers and of the Japanese people, who praised him for his leadership, fair-mindedness, and courage.

Delnore’s papers—which include policy statements, directives, speeches (most notably his 1948 address at the historic first Nagasaki ceremony commemorating victims of the atomic bombing), personal albums, photographs, lantern slides, letters, newspaper articles, and documentary films—reveal the sensitive and challenging nature of his work in post-war Japan.

The 2018 accural contains materials related to the Nagasaki Peace Ceremony in Nagasaki, Japan on August 9, 2014 and related events that Patricia Delnore Magee attended with her family. Materials include correspondence, newspaper clippings, certificates, a couple of pamphlets and a book, History of the 13th Armored Division (1992). """ ;

Co-founded by Carol Pierson, Wesley Horner, Jeff Rogers, Linda Pompa, Sean Collins and others, GLIPR was incorporated in 1991, and created panel discussions and staged events at annual Public Radio Conferences. Among their members were producers at NPR, station managers and program hosts, customer service reps at national and local organizations and music directors. GLIPR was an important part of the growth of the radio industry, and played a vital role in insuring diversity among public radio professionals. By the late 1990s, the group had become inactive, largely because GLIPR had achieved some success in their goals.

the collection includes Articles of Incorporation, correspondence, memos, newsletters, surveys, meeting minutes, program transcriptions and panel discussion outlines. """ ;

        schema1:description """John R. Harold, labor lawyer and Labor Relations Officer for the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) during the Occupation of Japan, was born on January 1, 1914. Raised in Yonkers, New York, he was one of nine children. He received an L.L.B. degree (Bachelor of Laws) from Manhattan College in 1934 and a J.D. from Fordham Law School in 1937. Throughout his 40-year legal career, he was committed to defending a worker’s right to protection by democratic labor practices.

In 1943, after working for several years in his own labor law practice, Harold was drafted. He served in several positions before he was recruited as a Labor Officer in the Labor Relations Branch of the Labor Division of the Economic and Scientific Section (ESS) of SCAP. As a Labor Officer, he was active in the enactment of new and democratic labor laws in Japan--in particular, the Labor Relations Adjustment Law enacted in September 1946, which created the procedures of conciliation, mediation, and voluntary arbitration and assigned those functions to tripartite Labor Relations Committees. Upon enactment of this law, his primary responsibility was administering a vast educational campaign to inform the Japanese labor force of the meaning and purpose of the new labor laws.

The papers of John R. Harold cover the years 1945-1983 with the vast majority of the material dating from the period of the Allied Occupation of Japan (1945-1949). The collection provides an overview of Occupation labor policy as documented in memoranda, correspondence, reports, news dispatches, newspaper articles, pamphlets, posters, slides, a kamishibai, and journals. Its focus is on labor education and includes materials used at education conferences for Japanese trade unionists and conferences for Allied military government personnel. Harold co-authored several pamphlets with the chief of the Labor Education Branch, Richard Deverall, such as, “Organization and Structure of Trade Unions” and “Building Industrial Democracy through Sound Labor Contracts,” that were translated into Japanese and widely distributed.  Also included in the collection is research on Japanese wages, labor supply, production control, and reports on Japanese labor unions and labor agreements.

In addition to the files on official labor policy, two correspondence files provide a behind-the-scenes view of SCAP. The first is the correspondence between General MacArthur and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru regarding, among other things, the Economic Purge Directive, the use of the Japanese flag, and the national budget. The second is the correspondence between Charles L. Kades, Deputy Chief of the Government Section, and Colonel Whitney, Chief of the Government Section, much of which concerns preparations for the Japanese Judicial Mission to the United States in 1950.

John R. Harold used the materials in this collection in the writing of his autobiography, Living a Life of Social Significance. The autobiography is included in the collection.""" ;

Rountree came to New York in 1938 from Florida, where she had been writing a sports column for the Tampa Tribune and freelance work for the local CBS outlet. She worked for an advertising agency and later co-founded a production business, Radio House, Inc. that produced commercials and transcribed programs. She created Listen! The Women! on which five women guests answered provocative questions from listeners. Janet Flanner (later famous as the New Yorker correspondent, Genêt) first served as host, replaced by journalist Dorothy Thompson.

Rountree also worked as production head at WLIB radio in New York and headed the Department of Special Events for the Mutual network. She created Leave It to the Girls, a comedy question-and-answer series, and Meet the Press, where she acted as moderator as well as producer. Both radio programs later moved to television. Rountree also created and produced several other radio and television programs, including Keep Posted, Washington Exclusive, Press Conference, and Capitol Closeup. After leaving Meet the Press in 1953, Rountree went on the lecture circuit. In the 1960s and 1970s, she began a crusade against "moral pollution," encouraging women to fight against drugs and pornography to reinstitute school prayer. 

The Martha Rountree papers date from 1940 to 2008, with the bulk of the material dating from 1945 to 1973. The collection consists of clippings about Rountree's broadcasting career, personal life, and political causes, several folders of photographs, and correspondence.

        schema1:description """Roger Bower (1903-1979) was active in broadcasting from 1925 to 1974. He joined radio station WOR in New York in 1928 and became a combination producer, director, actor, announcer, and sound effects engineer. During that time, WOR became the flagship station of the Mutual radio network, and Bower directed many prominent programs, including It Pays to be Ignorant, and Can You Top This? In the early 1930s, Bower announced the first Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which he continued to describe for many years. He gave one of the first (closed circuit) television demonstrations in 1933, in a Macy's department store window. Bower remained with WOR for 24 years, until the station was sold in 1952.

In later years, he assisted in developing television and radio networks in Cairo, Damascus, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Iran while working for (in order) the State Department, then NBC International, and, finally, the International Executive Service Corporation of New York City.

This collection primarily documents Bower's career at radio station WOR in New York City.

In 1956 he served as a special consultant on overseas television projects for the United States Information Agency's Voice of America.

A pioneer Alabama broadcaster, Holt and his business partner Edward L. Norton leased Birmingham's WAPI-AM from a local group of businessmen (incorporated as "The Voice of Alabama") from 1937 to 1953. During that time, Holt and Norton established FM radio and television for the first time in the state; they launched WAFM (later called WAPI-FM and now WJOX-FM) in 1947 and the first television station in Alabama, WAFM-TV (now WVTM-TV) in 1949. 

The Alabama Educational Television Commission was created in 1953, and Holt and Norton were employed to supervise the planning and construction of the first and any subsequent non-commercial TV stations. When the first two stations began broadcasting in 1955, Alabama became the nation's first state with an educational television network. Holt was an early proponent of using satellites for transmission of educational programs. 

The collection documents Holt's career in Alabama broadcasting from 1930 to 1980 in educational television, cable television, and satellite broadcasting. It includes business records, business, and personal correspondence, financial records, and other documents.

He appeared regularly on network radio from 1945 to 1972, and on television from 1948 to 1959. His radio career began on WFBR in Baltimore in 1930 and concluded with Arthur Godfrey Time on the CBS network in 1972. Through most of the decade of the 1950s, Godfrey not only hosted a daily radio program but two top-ten prime time television shows, Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts and Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, all for CBS. By 1959, total advertising billings from Godfrey's TV shows were estimated at an industry-high $150 million.

The Thirteen/WNET Arthur Godfrey collection spans 1923 to 1983, with the bulk of the collection encompassing the years 1950 up through the late 1970s. The collection contains an extensive series of sheet music and business records. It also contains publicity clippings, scripts, personal correspondence,photographs, and recordings of Godfrey's programs.

(Vox Pop is a shortened form of the Latin phrase "vox populi," which means the "voice of the people.") The program, originally called Sidewalk Interviews, began on local radio in Houston in 1932. KTRH advertising salesmen Parks Johnson and Jerry Belcher went out onto the street with portable microphones and asked people their opinions on a variety of topics. The spontaneity of the show proved popular with listeners.

In 1935, Vox Pop became a national program on the NBC network, broadcasting from different locations around New York City. In 1939, the show was broadcast from the New York World's Fair and was one of the first televised programs. Vox Pop participated extensively in the war effort, traveling up to 1,000 miles per week throughout the United States, visiting military bases, military schools, factories, and showcasing different communities on the home front. The show traveled to 45 states, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, France, and England.

The format of the show changed over the years. From a sidewalk interview program, Vox Pop soon became a straight quiz show. The program later combined quiz questions with interviews featuring movie stars, celebrities, sports figures, politicians, and other people in the news. Eventually, the quiz show structure was dropped entirely, and the program centered around one human interest story with guests lined up in advance.

Parks Johnson was one of the hosts throughout the life of the radio program. Jerry Belcher left the show in 1936 and was replaced by Wally Butterworth, a well-known radio announcer. Butterworth hosted the show with Parks from 1936 until 1942, then was replaced by Warren Hull, an actor and former emcee of radio's Your Hit Parade. This team stayed together until Vox Pop went off the air in 1948.

Vox Pop broadcast a total of 1,014 regular programs and 500 special programs. The show moved from NBC to CBS in late 1939 and jumped networks again in 1947 to ABC. The last program aired on May 19, 1948. There was some discussion as late as 1964 to televise Vox Pop, but nothing was ever produced.""" ;

He came to educational and instructional broadcasting via Encyclopedia Britannica Films, where he oversaw the creation of films and filmstrips for the classroom. In 1951, Fletcher became president of the Fund for Adult Education, a part of the Ford Foundation. For the next ten years, Fletcher helped establish the first thirty noncommercial television stations in the United States.

He also helped fund the first educational television program service, the National Educational Television and Radio Center (NETRC). In 1964, he served as a consultant to the Educational Television Stations (ETS) division of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. In this capacity, he convened a national meeting in 1964 to discuss the long-range financing of educational broadcasting. This conference resulted in the formation of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television and led to the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.

The collection chronicles Fletcher's involvement in the Fund for Adult Education, the Educational Television Stations division of the NAEB, and other public broadcasting positions. Types of documents include awards, clippings, correspondence, minutes, newsletters, notes, reports, speeches, and writings.

        schema1:description """Ralph Waldo Steetle, Sr. (1912-2004) a prime mover in the creation of public television, began working in educational radio at Louisiana State University. There he was director of broadcasting and helped build WLSU (later renamed KLSU), one of the first non-commercial FM radio stations in the south. 

He spent ten years in Washington, D.C. as Executive Director of the Joint Council on Educational Television (JCET), under a Ford Foundation grant. JCET served as an advocacy organization that helped get the first 50 public television stations on the air.
While at JCET, Steetle worked on the FCC Third Report and Order, issued in 1951. This report tentatively set aside 209 channels, approximately 10 percent of all stations, for educational television. The FCC's Sixth Report and Order, issued in 1952, affirmed the arguments made by JCET for educational stations and expanded the number of reserved channels to 242.

In 1960 Steetle moved to Oregon to become the Associate Dean of Continuing Education and Director of Education Media for the Oregon State System of Higher Education. He capped his professional career developing the Oregon Public Television Network. 

The collection chronicles the early history of the Joint Committee on Educational Television and Steetle's involvement in this organization.

He was chancellor of the University of Wisconsin's extension services from 1965 to 1968. In 1968, McNeil received the first Emmy given to a public television station (WHA-TV) for his series "Pretty Soon Runs Out," a forum on integration and race relations. He was provost of the unified University of Maine, a merger of five state colleges and three university campuses, from 1969 to 1975. He was elected to the board of the Public Broadcasting Service in 1973.
 
McNeil became the president of the University of Mid-America (UMA) in 1978. UMA was an experiment in teaching, modeled on the Open University of Great Britain, that existed from 1974 to 1982. It used electronic media to produce long-distance learning courses marketed in eleven mid-west universities. After UMA failed, McNeil began to design and research a similar effort to give credit and degrees based upon a curriculum using technology as a classroom. The New York Institute of Technology agreed to consider this American Open University as a long-distance arm. McNeil served as provost from 1983 to 1987. He began creating the National Public Broadcasting Archives in 1988 and served as its director from 1990 until his retirement in 1993.

The Remley papers describe his work both on the Video Tape Engineering Committee of the National Educational Television and Radio Center and as part of the efforts to standardize videotape format internationally.

He served as chairman of PBS from 1973 to 1979. He was widely credited with resisting the Nixon Administration's efforts to push public television out of public affairs broadcasting and cut its financing.

Rogers became interested in public broadcasting in the late 1960s, serving as chairman of KERA-TV in Dallas from 1968 to 1972. In 1972, Rogers chaired a board of lay leaders to examine the possibilities of long-range financing for public broadcasting. Rogers became chief executive of a recently reorganized PBS in 1973 and remained in this position until Newton C. Minow succeeded him in 1978.

The collection contains correspondence, memoranda, and reports regarding the Office of Telecommunications Policy, the financing of public broadcasting, and the formation of PBS.

In that role, he captured major campus events and documented a gamut of routine activities. Danegger also served on the university faculty for 27 years, teaching courses in photojournalism, general photography, and general education. This collection consists of one film created from spliced photographs by Danegger depicting repatriation of Japanese civilians and military personnel after World War II, and photographs taken during Danegger's student days from 1946 to the early 1950s. Many of these photographs appeared in university publications such as the Old Line magazine and the Terrapin yearbook. Subjects include the rifle team, football, student publications, Gymkana, University Theatre, Autumn Carnival, students' social lives, fraternity parties, and coed glamour shots." ;

At the Mercer Literary Society meetings, members developed oratory skills and listed to speakers debate the major issues of the day.

The original society was reconfigured several times during its existence, ultimately becoming the New Mercer Literary Society in 1896.

In 1913, he accepted an appointment as Assistant Entomologist in the Division of Cereal and Forage Insect Investigations of the then U. S. Bureau of Entomology, with assignment at the National Museum in Washington. Gahan retired in 1951. His son, James B. Gahan (1909-1996) also graduated from the University of Maryland. His daughter Winifred Gahan (1910-2002), was also a University of Maryland graduate and was active in local civic and church affairs, and was named \"Prince Georgian of the Year\" in 1993. The Gahan Family Papers spans the period 1905 through 2003 and consists of publications in the field of Entomology, employment records, correspondence, photographs, certificates and awards, and biographical information relating to the Gahan family.

        schema1:description "The Grimes family of Oxon Hill, Prince George's County, Maryland maintained a farm as well as a store and tavern or 'ordinary' throughout the nineteenth century. For much of that time one family member or another served as postmaster for the area. In accordance with the contemporary convention of naming towns after the local postmaster, the town was then known as Grimesville. The Grimes family papers include financial ledgers from the store, daybooks recording work on the farm, weather, and local and family news, legal agreements about land and labor, and correspondence. While the Grimes family did not enslave people, they did participate in and benefit from the enslavement of people. Thomas Grimes (1794-1864) managed the store, ordinary, farm, and post office from about 1820 until his death. His son Richard Franklin (born 1835) assumed responsibilities in the family businesses as Thomas' health declined in the 1860s and maintained the businesses after his father died." ;

Fuegi holds a Ph. D. in comparative literature from the University of Southern California. In addition to the University of Maryland, he has taught at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Harvard University, Wesleyan University, and at institutions in Berlin and Mainz, Germany, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Support for Fuegi's seventeen books and films on subjects as diverse as Virginia Woolf and twelfth-century nun Hildegard of Bingen was derived from grants and awards by the Guggenheim Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, American Council of Learned Societies, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Danish Film Institute. An authority on the life and work of Bertolt Brecht, Fuegi was the founder of the International Brecht Society in 1970 and edited the first fourteen volumes of its Proceedings. The collection contains materials related to Fuegi's research for the book Brecht and Company: Sex, Politics, and the Making of Modern Drama(1994) and his award-winning film about Danish novelist Ruth Berlau, Red Ruth: That Deadly Longing (1992). The collection consists primarily of manuscripts, research files, and publicity materials for Brecht and Company. Materials also document Fuegi's activities in the field of Brecht scholarship through articles and audio-visual materials, records of the International Brecht Society, and significant correspondence with scholar Eric Bentley. Other materials include correspondence, clippings, and photographs relating to Bertolt Brecht's collaborators such as the writers Elisabeth Hauptmann, Ruth Berlau, and Margarete Steffin, and the dramaturge Robert Vambery. While some of the materials in the collection are originals, others are photocopies of extremely rare material such as records from the Bertolt Brecht Archive at Harvard University." ;

The Annual Reports of the Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station (University Publications UPUB A33.001), particularly 1907 to 1910, discuss the cooperative tobacco experiments with the United States Department of Agriculture that Brown supervised at Upper Marlboro. The "M Club Directory" (1941) has an entry for Brown (University Publication M1.001). Brown is also listed in the Registrar's ledger for the Maryland Agricultural College.

 Brown published several experiment station bulletins, including: Fertilizer Experiments with Tobacco (1919) with W. W. Garner (no. 225); Fertilizer Tests with Tobacco, with Special Reference to Effect of Different Rates and Sources of Nitrogen and Potash (1934) with J. E. McMurtrey and W. M.

        schema1:description "Felix Agnus (1839-1925) was a French sculptor and Austrian War veteran who achieved success as an officer in the 5th and 165th New York Infantry Regiments during the American Civil War. Agnus served in several campaigns and engagements, including the Peninsula Campaign, the Port Hudson Campaign, and Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign. In recognition of his gallantry, Agnus received numerous promotions, rising from the rank of rivate to Brevet Brigadier General. He settled in Baltimore after the war, eventually becoming business manager of the Baltimore American and later founding the Baltimore Star. Agnus's papers consist of military and personal correspondence from the American Civil War, with the bulk of the materials from 1861-1865. The military correspondence is primarily bureaucratic paperwork, including enlistment and promotion papers, ordnance department returns, and letters." ;

Marshall Chapman, the second of John Grant Chapman's sons, inherited the Chapman estate upon his father's death in 1856. Records show that the family enslaved many people on their plantation (32 people as of the 1800 U.S. Federal Census and 140 people by 1850). Much of the personal correspondence in this collection concerns this branch of the Chapman family. Andrew Grant Chapman, another of John Grant Chapman's sons, followed directly in his father's footsteps and served in the Maryland House of Delegates and the U.S. House of Representatives. A third son, Robert F. Chapman, attended the University of Maryland Medical School in Baltimore and later moved to New York City to work for Bellevue Hospital.

During a long career in Washington, D.C., his positions included director of the Economic Section of the Legislative Reference Service at the Library of Congress, Librarian of the Supreme Court, General Counsel for the Bureau of the Budget, and Deputy Comptroller of the Currency. In addition, he was an authority on banking law and in his private law practice he served as counsel to many of the leading financial institutions and bank holding companies in the United States. His relationship with the Bank of America was particularly significant. Following his retirement in 1927, Collins devoted himself to restoring and renovating his home, an eighteenth-century estate known as \"Harmony Hall,\" and other properties he owned in Prince George's County, MD. He also wrote several books and pamphlets expressing his views supporting \"states' rights\" and segregation. Collins's wife, Sue Spencer Collins (1895-1983) shared his interest in historic preservation, and enjoyed researching her family's genealogy. She was active in organizations such as the Colonial Dames and Daughters of the Confederacy, as well as social organizations such as the Washington Club. Her other interests included flower arrangement, fashion, and cooking. The Papers of Charles Wallace Collins consist of correspondence, clippings, essays, articles, pamphlets, and other publications generated or collected by Collins and his wife, Sue Spencer Collins. Areas of emphasis include the restoration of Harmony Hall and the daily maintenance of the farm, Collins' consulting relationships with banks, and his views on segregation and civil rights. Sue Spencer Collins' papers deal with domesticity; social activities; family; and her own genealogical research." ;

His two major works, Presence of the Past: The History of the Preservation Movement in the United States Before Williamsburg and Preservation Comes of Age: From Williamsburg to the National Trust, 1926-1949 , have become standard teaching and reference texts in the historic preservation field. Hosmer's papers primarily consist of materials relating to these two books, including biographical and research notes, correspondence, manuscript drafts, articles from newspapers and periodicals, and book chapters. Also included in the collection are drafts of other articles and books Hosmer wrote, oral history interview tapes and transcripts, photographs, and microfilm." ;

An index to this collection is available at the Archives and Manuscripts Department in Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland.

 The historic preservation researcher may also find related materials at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley, whose oral history collections Hosmer used, and at the Cornell University Department of Archives and History, which contains a collection of oral history interview transcripts compiled by James Glass during the course of his dissertation research on aspects of the historic preservation movement. Principia College, Elsah, Illinois, holds a collection of Hosmer's correspondence relating to interviews conducted for use in Preservation Comes of Age.

 There are copies of Hosmer's two published works: Presence of the Past (call number E159.H77) and Preservation Comes of Age (call number NA106.H67) among the holdings of the National Trust for Historic Preservation Library Collection at the University of Maryland Libraries. The Trust Library also holds an extensive collection of books, articles, and other printed material concerning all aspects of the field of historic preservation.

This was one of the largest and deadliest wars in the history of the world, involving over 70 million military troops, not to mention the millions of civilians that were affected and lost their lives. Hundreds of songs were written in the United States during and about the war, pertaining to themes such as patriotic duty, separation from loved ones, and the noble bravery of the troops, and more - all of which provided valuable insight into the culture and mindset of Americans during the War. The Hugo Keesing collection on music and World War I consists of sheet music and newspaper publications from the United States published contemporaneously with, or pertaining to, World War I. The bulk of the materials cover the period 1917–1919, from the onset of American involvement to the years immediately following the war. The collection is organized into two series.

        schema1:description """The Chester E. Whiting collection contains material relating to Whiting's career with the U.S. Army, including his role in creating and leading the U.S. Army Field Band. Materials in it date from 1919 to 2015, but the bulk dates are 1946-1960. The collection has a varied provenance, which is reflected in its arrangement and description. The first box of material is from Frank Whiting, Jr., Chester’s nephew. Frank Whiting, Sr. was a member of the Americal Division Band and the Army Field Band. These materials were collected by that branch of the family. They include photographs, pages of Frank’s scrapbook, band publicity materials, and information specific to Chester. The second box contains material collected by Susan Robinson, Chester’s daughter. It includes pages from her mother Helen’s scrapbook, as well as publicity photos, recordings, letters, and personal photos. Most of the remaining materials were gathered from various sources by Richard W. Taylor in preparation for articles about Whiting and the Field Band (also included in the collection). They include books, programs, promotional material, photographs, and copies of material pulled from collections at the National Archives. Additional materials of unknown provenance include two swords and a hat presumably used for parades and high-profile performances. 
	The collection is strongest at documenting Whiting’s career with various Army bands, including the Field Band. There is especially useful photographic evidence conveying the life of a military musician during and after WWII. Although there is very little about Whiting’s activities as a School Board Member in this collection, much of that activity is documented in the Ruth S. Wolf Papers and Prince George’s County Council of Parent-Teachers’ Associations records held in UMD’s Special Collections and University Archives.

All eight eligible Mrs. Shippens were married to descendants of the British-born Edward Shippen (1639-1712), who immigrated to America in 1668, eventually establishing a home with his family in Philadelphia. Shippen was a successful merchant and eventually a powerful political figure as the first elected mayor of Philadelphia in 1702. This collection consists of one of these Mrs. Shippens’ sheet music: early 19th-century publications from England and Ireland, consisting of mostly piano compositions, along with several arrangements for voice, harp, and flute.

Jolson was a Russian-born American singer, comedian, and actor, with a reputation for performing material that is racist while in blackface. For the ethos of Jolson's time, this was acceptable performance practice and programming." ;

His father wanted Aaron to study medicine and sent him to Switzerland for that purpose in 1913. Instead, he enrolled in the Zürich Conservatory, where, for a few months, he received his only formal training in music. After the outbreak of World War I, Avshalomov left Europe, returning to Russia and then moving on to China and the United States, where he married his first wife, Esther Magidson, in 1916. The couple immigrated to China the following year, and Aaron stayed in the country even after they divorced and Esther and their son, Jacob, returned to the United States in 1919. Most of the next thirty years of Avshalomov’s life was spent in China, where he served as head librarian of the Municipal Library of Shanghai (1928-43), helped form the Chinese Music Study Society, and conducted the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra (1943-6).

After living under house arrest during the Japanese occupation of China, Aaron joined his son in the United States in 1947, where he attempted to recreate the success he had found in China.

        schema1:description """Irmgard Bartenieff (née Dombois, b. February 24, 1900, Berlin; died August 27, 1981, New York City) was a German-born American dancer, choreographer, teacher, Labanotator, dance therapist, physical therapist, dance historian, and activist. During the 1920s, Bartenieff studied modern dance, movement analysis, and movement notation at the Rudolf Laban School in Munich and danced with the Tanzbühne Laban. She taught and performed in Berlin and Stuttgart, Germany through her own studio and company, Romantisches Tanztheater Barténieff.

After immigrating to the United States in 1937, she taught Laban’s theories and dance notation and continued studies in massage therapy, eventually opening a private practice with her husband, Michail Bartenieff, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts where she worked until 1942. In 1946, Bartenieff was awarded a certificate from the New York University School of Physical Therapy; she was later licensed in New York and maintained a private practice while also working with polio patients and people with mental illness at hospitals throughout her life. 

Eventually combining dance and therapy, Bartenieff was a founding member of the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). She was also a member of the Dance Notation Bureau (DNB) and the International Council on Kinetography Laban (ICKL). She taught analysis and synthesis of movement, wrote and published several articles, lectured across the United States, gave demonstrations in Bewegungsmassage in the United States and Europe, and taught Laban’s Effort-Shape theories at the DNB. 

In 1977, she started the Laban Institute for Movement Studies (LIMS)—later known as the Laban/Bartenieff Institute for Movement Studies—to teach Laban movement analysis (LMA). Having developed her own theoretical approach to the study of LMA (Bartenieff Fundamentals (BF)), and set of exercises (the Basic 6), she published a book “Body Movement: Coping with the Environment” co-authored by Dori Lewis in 1980. Bartenieff died on August 27, 1981 in New York City. 

The Bartenieff papers include 103 boxes (record storage, document cases, score boxes, photograph binders, audio cassette and index card boxes, oversized flat boxes, and one map-case folder) comprising 54.0 linear feet.""" ;

The bulk of the materials in the Frank Simon score collection date from early in Frank Simon's career through his years as the leader of the ARMCO Band. A few items appear to be from his years teaching at the Cinncinatti Conservatory of Music and the University of Arizona. These materials show the wide range of music the band performed as well as the special emphasis on marches by John Philip Sousa and arrangements by Herman Bellstedt. That emphasis signifies the special relationship Simon had with each man. Bellstedt, a soloist and arranger for Sousa's band, had been Simon's cornet teacher. Later Bellstedt recommended Simon to Sousa, who hired Simon to play in his band in 1914. Simon left Sousa's band in 1920, but continued to reference his time in the band for the rest of his career.

Samaroff maintained a highly successful career as a performing artist, until an injury to her left arm in 1926 compelled Samaroff to cancel all concerts for the season, after which she accepted the position of chief music critic of the New York Evening Post which she continued for two years. Her broad knowledge, varied musical experience and clear style were highly praised. The Post attempted to retain her for three more years but she declined their offer to devote herself to educational work and lecturing. Samaroff's services as a lecturer were in great demand. She appeared at Yale, Harvard, Columbia and many of America's finest universities. Notwithstanding her eminent position as a virtuoso, a critic, an author, lecturer and organizer, Samaroff is perhaps best known for her distinguished career as a teacher.

        schema1:description """Claude Thomas Smith was an American educator, conductor, and composer born in Missouri in 1932. A prolific composer, Smith completed over 110 compositions for band, twelve orchestral works, and fifteen choral pieces. His compositions include the works Emperata Overture which was featured at the 1964 Mid-West Band and Orchestra Clinic; Eternal Father Strong to Save which was commissioned in 1975 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Navy Band and premiered at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C; and Flight which was adopted as the "official march" of the Smithsonian Institute's National Air and Space Museum. Smith worked as an instrumental music educator in Nebraska and Missouri until 1976, developing during that time a pedagogical system that was later codified in his band method books, and from 1976-1978 was a professor at Southwest Missouri State University. Upon leaving the University in 1978, Smith's focus became primarily on composing, which he continued until his death in 1987. 

The collection, part of the ABA Research Center, contains manuscript condensed and full scores, editing/correction scores, and published scores written throughout Smith's career. All scores are arranged alphabetically by composition title. The bulk of these manuscripts are editing/correction scores that document the final stages of Smith's creative process.""" ;

She began composing at the age of nine and had her first composition, \"Conglomera,\" premiered by her Junior High School Orchestra in Hingham, MA in 1964. She received a degree in Spanish from Smith College in 1973, and later studied to be a translator at the Monterey Institute. In 1982, Steele received her Master's degree from American University, where she composed a full length opera, \"Dominique,\" and went on to receive a Doctorate from the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music in 1993. An active member of the American Women Composers of Massachusetts, she served as the organization's vice-president in 1993 and then as president from 1993 to 1996. After receiving her doctorate, Steele's interests turned more towards singing than composing although her works were still performed, both by herself and by others. One of her main interests was in Scandinavian composers and art song, which she traveled to Sweden to study in the summer of 1999. She had been diagnosed with cancer, yet remained a vibrant and active personality, giving concerts and remaining active as a musician until her death on December 10, 2002.

        schema1:description "John Curwen (1816-1880) was an English congregational minister who, later in life, devoted himself to developing and promulgating the Tonic Sol-fa pedagogical method. This method is based on the relationships between pitch-classes in a diatonic key, and replaces traditional notation with solfege syllables; the syllable \"do\" is assigned to a piece's tonic, thus the term \"moveable do.\" The John Curwen Manuscripts, part of the National Association for Music Education (NAfME) Historical Center (previously the Music Educators National Convention (MENC) Historical Center), contains six volumes written by Curwen that date from 1863 to 1868. These manuscripts frequently include pasted-in materials and feature Curwen's preparatory work for future harmony textbooks and exercises completed by students. Supporting materials are also part of the collection, giving biographical information, examples of tonic sol-fa, and a brief history of how the materials were acquired." ;

In 1911, he formed his own band which began a summer concert series, later know as the Guggenhiem Memorial Concert Series, in New York City in 1918. This tradition continued under other directors, including Goldman's son, Richard Franko Goldman, who led the band from 1956 to 1979. Goldman championed the performance of neglected band music giving the American premieres of a number of important works, including commissioned pieces from many contemporary composers such as Ottorino Respighi, Percy Grainger, Morton Gould, and Virgil Thomson. The collection contains press-books of clippings, programs, press releases, correspondence, memorabilia, and photographs related to the Goldman Band's annual summer concerts in New York City; and correspondence, articles, administrative records, conference programs, committee reports, and memorabilia related to Goldman's tenure as president of the American Bandmasters Association." ;

        schema1:description "Leopold Stokowski (1882-1977) was an American conductor, who led the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, American Youth Orchestra, New York City Symphony, Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra, NBC Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Houston Symphony Orchestra, and American Symphony Orchestra. His career began with studies at the Royal College of Music in 1896 when Stokowski was just 13. He performed as an organist and choral director for several years in England, Europe and the U.S. before becoming director of the Cincinnati Orchestra in 1909. During his career, Stokowski promoted Modern and late Romantic music, combining an avant-garde approach with a traditional glamour that drew audiences of all sorts to his performances. Today he is perhaps most well known for his collaboration with Walt Disney on the movie Fantasia." ;

The collection’s broad scope provides insight into music education and social mindsets of the United States over the past century. Studying the resources available to teachers can reveal the employment of different educational methods over time; in addition, study of the types of songs and song collections being published and sold to the public can reveal the societal traits of a population from a particular time period.

KMTI and KCA trained master teachers, conducted research on American folk music, developed curricula and model schools, published resources for teaching and scholarship, and disseminated information.

The Kodály Center of America records contain primarily KCA’s organizational records from 1977 to 2000. Additional materials include KMTI’s records, the bulk of which date from 1969 to 1977, and the personal and professional papers of Denise Bacon, which date from about 1900 to 2014.""" ;
